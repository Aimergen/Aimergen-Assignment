                    <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure
                        about how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design
                        wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the
                        Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone
                        variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin
                        originated from our Medium blog post, 'Designing voice and tone for error messages.
